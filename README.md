#### I'm Shiyao Xu. 

👧🏻 I'm now a research assistant at Tsinghua University, working with [Prof. Yebin Liu](http://www.liuyebin.com/). 
I just obtain my MS degree from [WICT](http://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University, June 2023. I'm looking for a Ph.D. position from now.
👩🏻‍💻 More details can be found on [my website](https://xusy2333.com) 👈🏻

😎 My research interest lies in 3D-aware generation and NeRF. I would like to build the bridge between 2D and 3D world.
