#### I'm Shiyao Xu. 

👧🏻 I'm now a 1st-year ELLIS PhD student at [MHUG](https://mhug.disi.unitn.it/), University of Trento, Italy, supervised by [Prof. Paolo Rota](https://paolorota.github.io/).
I obtained my MS degree from [WICT](http://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University, June 2023.

👩🏻‍💻 More details can be found on [my website](https://xusy2333.com) 👈🏻

😎 My research interest lies in 3D-aware scene understanding and generation, basically the intersection of 3D Vision and VLM. I would like to build a bridge between the 2D and 3D worlds.
